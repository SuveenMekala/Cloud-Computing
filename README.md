# Cloud-Computing
Course work for CS 553

This repo contains the programming assignments done during the course. 

->The assignment 1 is about the benchmarking of the cpu, disk, memory, network and GPU. 

->The assignment 2 is on AWS and the requirement is to compare the speeds of computation of shared memory, Hadoop and Spark. 
...The AWS instances used are i3.large, i3.4xlarge of 128 GB and 1TB. Also cluster of 8 nodes were setup for equivalent comparision. 
...The data is randomly generated and is of 128GB and 1TB. 
...The aim of the program is to run TeraSort and compute performance on different implementations.
...The virtual clusters are setup using automation scripts.

->The project required us to estimate the cost of setting up a virtual private cloud and a public cloud like AWS. 
...Cost is estimated for 3 configurations. Each configuration is based on instances on AWS- d2.8xlarge, r3.large, p3.16xlarge.
...Amortized and breakeven costs are calculated.
...The calculated costs include the cost of maintenance, setting up the network, servers, network switches, cables, racks, cooling, power,administration, etc
